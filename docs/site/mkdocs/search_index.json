To begin distributing dimensions and measures to Qlik Sense applications, complete the tasks below.\n\n\n\n\nCreate the Metrics Library app\n.\n\n\nCreate Metrics Library Field Names \n Data Connection\n.\n\n\nCreate a reload task for the Metrics Library app\n.\n\n\nCreate a tag for marking governed dimensions and measures\n\n\nCreate the ManagedMasterItems custom property and add values\n\n\nApply the ManagedMasterItems custom property values to apps\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 1: Create the Metrics Library App\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Hub, create an app called \"Metrics Library\"\n\n\nIn the Metrics Library app, create a Data Connection to your source data. For more information on Metrics Library configuration and requirements: \nlink\n\n\nReload the Metrics Library app to verify you are connected and loading in the correct data. \n\n\nSave and close the app (it is okay to leave in the My Work stream)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 2: Create Metrics Library App Field Names \n Data Connection\n\n\nThe Metrics Library app is the main application the Governed Metrics Service reads during the update process to apply dimensions and measures to all associated applications.  \nThe app requires specific named fields to work properly.\n \n\n\nYou must create a Data Connection to the data source in the Metrics Library app using the specifications below. The data source can be created manually or you can use the example data that was included in the installation. Please see the \nexample\n after reviewing the configuration requirements. \n\n\nThe source data for the Metrics Library app - the central list of metrics - can be loaded from any data source.  However, when loading the data, the field names must conform to the following and contain the specified information. \n\n\nField Name definitions for the Metrics Library data source:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n - The unique ID can be generated in the load script automatically or defined in your data source. There is an example \nhere\n of how to generate it in the script. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricSubject\n - The MetricSubject MUST equal the \nManagedMasterItems\n custom property value.  When the Governed Metrics Service reads the Metrics Library app tables, this field is used to identify which apps will receive the dimension or measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricType\n - This field identifies where in the Master Library a metric will be added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricName\n - The MetricName field contains the friendly name displayed in the Master Library for the dimension or measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricDescription\n - This field contains a description for the dimension or measure.  When a user clicks on a Master Library item, the description will appear in the pop user interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricFormula\n - The MetricFormula contains the dimension field name or the expression to be used for the dimension or measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricOwner\n - This field identifies who owns the metric for informational purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricTags\n - The MetricTags page is a semicolon delimited list of descriptive tags to be added to the dimension or measure Master Library item to aid search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Source Data Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n\n\nMetricSubject\n\n\nMetricType\n\n\nMetricName\n\n\nMetricDescription\n\n\nMetricFormula\n\n\nMetricOwner\n\n\nMetricTags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nCustomer Service\n\n\nMeasure\n\n\n% Resolved in SLA\n\n\nPercentage of Tickets handled within SLA\n\n\nSum({\n [Call Ctr Days to Resolve] = {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6'} \n } [Call Ctr Call #])/sum([Call Ctr Call #])\n\n\nLinda Lee\n\n\nKey KPI;Call\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nSales\n\n\nDimension\n\n\nCountry\n\n\nCustomer Country\n\n\nCustomer Country\n\n\nChad Johnson\n\n\nCustomer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nFinance\n\n\nMeasure\n\n\nCosts\n\n\nCost Amount\n\n\nsum([Sales Costs])\n\n\nGordon Wyse\n\n\nCost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetricsLibrary:\n\n    LOAD\n    RowNo() AS ID, //ID does not exist in source data so we generate it in the script\n    MetricSubject,\n    MetricType,\n    MetricName,\n    MetricDescription,\n    MetricFormula,\n    MetricOwner,\n    MetricTags\n    FROM [lib://AttachedFiles/MetricsLibrary.csv]\n    (txt, codepage is 1252, embedded labels, delimiter is '\\t', msq);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create a reload task for the Metrics Library app\n\n\nAfter creating the Metrics Library app, a reload task needs to be created for it so the Governed Metrics Service can request updated metrics before applying them to apps.\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the Metrics Library app in QMC and click \"More actions\"\n\n\nSelect the \"Create new reload task option\"\n\n\nName the task the same value entered in the task name provided during the installation of the GMS itself. \"Reload task of Metrics Library\" is the default.\n\n\nSave the task and exit.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create a gms tag to mark dimensions and measures.\n\n\nTo assist the creation, modification, and deletion of dimensions and measures using the Governed Metrics Service, the process applies a tag to created items.  This tag needs to be created in the QMC before it can be used by the process.\n\n\nTo create the gms tag:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the Tags menu item in the QMC.\n\n\nClick the \"Create New\" button.\n\n\nEnter \ngms\n into the Name field.\n\n\nClick Apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Create the ManagedMasterItems custom property and add values\n\n\nIn order to identify the applications that will receive metrics, the ManagedMasterItems custom property contains the values to be applied to apps.\n\n\nLooking back on the sample source data table above, observe the MetricsSubject column.  This column directly corresponds to the values entered into the ManagedMasterItems custom property.  For the different metrics supplied from the data source, a MetricsSubject identifies the apps that will receive the dimension or measure in the master library.\n\n\nTo create the ManagedMasterItems custom property:\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the Custom Properties menu item in the QMC.  \n\n\nClick \"Create new\" and provide a name for the custom property that matches the value entered in the configuration page of the Governed Metrics Service install. In this example we use \"ManagedMasterItems\"\n\n\nSelect the \"Apps\" resource checkbox.\n\n\nAdd values to the custom property that match values in the MetricsSubject field and click apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Apply the ManagedMasterItems custom property values to apps\n\n\nNow that the custom property for populating metrics to applications exists, the values need to be set on applications for when the Governed Metrics Service performs an update.\n\n\nDo not apply ManagedMasterItems custom property values to the Metrics Library application.\n\n\nTo add a custom property value to an app:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back to the Apps section of the QMC and double click on an App reference in the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the app screen appears, activate the Custom properties section by clicking on the term located on the right side of the screen.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the dialog box next to ManagedMasterItems (or the custom property created for GMS) and type or select the custom property values to apply to the app.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps - Installing the Governed Metrics Service.

If a different hostname (e.g. a hostname associated with a trusted certificate) is going to be used to connect to Qlik Sense, check the check box and enter the hostname that will be used in the text box.  Click the Next button to provide references to the certificate to use this hostname.   \n7. If the check box on the previous screen is checked, a trusted certificate is necessary to make a secure connection to the integration with the common hostname entered.  This screen prompts for certificate file references.\nThe certificate file location box accepts PEM or PFX file certificates.  When a PEM file is selected, a subsequent box will appear requiring a key file.  If a pfx file is selected, a passphrase is required to open the certificate file and read the private key.  Click the Next button to proceed with the installation.      \n8. The installer is ready to place files on the system.  Click Install to begin the installation.      \n9. Once the installer places files on the system, the installer adds the configuration information entered earlier into the tool.  Click the Next button to continue.       \n10. The Service Dispatcher message dialog explains how the Governed Metrics Service uses the Qlik Sense Service Dispatcher to run.  The Service Dispatcher services.conf file will be updated during this step.  Click Next to continue.      \n11. Click the Finish button to complete the installation.",
