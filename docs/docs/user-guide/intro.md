[<img src="/img/PowerToolsLogoNew.png">](https://community.qlik.com/community/qlik-sense/ea-powertools) 

The Governed Metrics Service (GMS) Powertool provides the ability to control and provision the use of governed Master Items. Master Items are defined as dimensions or measures located in an app's Master Library. 



## How does it work?

GMS loads externally defined metrics and applies them to one or more designated applications. Complete with an installation and test page, GMS will quickly have you on the right track to governed self-service. 

GMS is a REST api + node.js-based module that plugs into the existing Qlik Service Dispatcher framework.
